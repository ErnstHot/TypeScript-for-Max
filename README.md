# TypeScript for Cycling '74 Max / MSP / Jitter

Examples showing how to use the Max Javascript type definitions available as part
of the DefinitelyTyped project and more broadly how to compile Javascript that Max
can run.

`npm install @types/maxmsp --save-dev`

If you want to contribute to the type definitions themselves please see [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped)

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the recommended TypeScript IDE.

Follow
[this guide](https://cmatskas.com/getting-started-with-typescript-and-sublime-text/)
to set up Sublime Text.

## Getting started

Clone this repo to your `Max 8/Library` folder

Install its dependencies with `npm install`. You can then compile the `.ts`
files in `src` to max compatible es3 javascript by running either
`npm run compile` or `tsc`.

Once you have done this you will see the compiled js files in the `dist` folder
and you can open the patches in the `maxpatches` folder.

## Using the definitions in your own project

You can install these types in your own project by using the command
`npm install @types/maxmsp --save-dev`

You should ensure that your `tsconfig.json` is set up in a similar one
to this project as there are a few important things that you need to note:

* Max uses an archaic es5 javascript (for more information see
  [here](https://cycling74.com/forums/any-plans-to-update-support-for-recent-versions-of-js#reply-58ed21d5c2991221d9ccad8c)),
  which means that for lots of modern functionality you will need to include
  polyfills. In our `tsconfig.json` we define this `"target": "es5",` and this
  means that we also need to set `"ignoreDeprecations": "5.0",` because es3
  support will soon be dropped by Typescript

* `tsconfig.json` includes `"lib": ["es5"]` to stop Typescript from trying to use
DOM declarations. Not including this lib directive results in duplicate declaration
errors because some max items share names with DOM items.

* We configure the types so that we can use them from the top level by including
  the line `"types": ["maxmsp"],` in our `tsconfig.json`

## API Documentation

See
[Max Javascript Reference](http://max-javascript-reference.tim-schenk.de/#gsc.tab=0)
for full documentation on all functions and properties.

## Notes

* The TypeScript configuration file (`tsconfig.json`) is set up to output a
  separate .js file for each .ts file.

* .ts files for scripts to be used in a [js] or [jsui] object must end in:

       let module = {};
       export = {};

   This tricks tsc in outputting it as a separate module file, while still
   allowing Max to read it as a script. Do not do this in module files.

* Make sure the compiled JavaScript files are in Max' search path, set this with
  `"outDir"` in your `tsconfig.json`. Make sure your TypeScript folder is not in
  a Max project directory or Max will mess up the file structure.

* For continuous development run `tsc --watch` in the directory with your
  `tsconfig.json`. The .js files are then generated on save and Max will then
  reload automatically.

* For more information on configuration files, look [here](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/tsconfig-json.html).

* Import modules using non local paths. Max will resolve `ExampleModule` but
`./ExampleModule` will not work without path rewriting. In more complex projects
where you may want to hide subdirectories or use shorter paths you might need to
include a paths directive in your `tsconfig.json`. For example:

```json
"paths": {
      "Cursor": [
        "Cursor/Cursor"
      ]
}
```

## Assigning properties to objects of type Global

Cast to `<any>` to assign properties to objects of type `Global` like so:

```Typescript
var g = new Global("Foo");
(<any>g).newProperty = "I am new.";
post("(<any>g).newProperty: " + (<any>g).newProperty + "\n");
```
